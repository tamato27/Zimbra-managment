# Zimbra-scripts

This is my first git code
This script i wrote to be able to create users in bulk from a csv file
The columns names in the csv you can change in the python script because the zmprov needs it in a certain order 
script creates the username (email) password and the display name, teher is also a few attributes that can be added see the code for examples 
all explained in the python script
And oh yes you need to install pandas too :)

Future updates id like to create a packaged .deb file so anyone can run it without python or the libraries used
Hope it helps some one
